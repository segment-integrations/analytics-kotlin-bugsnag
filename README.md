# Analytics-Kotlin BugSnag

Add Bugsnag support to your applications via this plugin for [Analytics-Kotlin](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-kotlin)

## Adding the dependency
To install the Segment-bugsnag integration, simply add this line to your gradle file:

```
implementation 'com.segment.analytics.kotlin.destinations:bugsnag:<latest_version>'
```
Or the following for Kotlin DSL
```
implementation("com.segment.analytics.kotlin.destinations:bugsnag:<latest_version>")
```

Also add the BugSnag Gradle plugin dependency to your project level build.gradle.
```
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        // ...
        classpath "com.bugsnag:bugsnag-android-gradle-plugin:7.4.1"
    }
}
```
Or the following for Kotlin DSL
```
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        // ...
        classpath("com.bugsnag:bugsnag-android-gradle-plugin:7.4.1")
    }
}
```

## Using the Plugin in your App

Open the file where you setup and configure the Analytics-Kotlin library. Add this plugin to the list of imports.

```
import com.segment.analytics.kotlin.destinations.bugsnag.BugsnagDestination
```

Just under your Analytics-Kotlin library setup, call `analytics.add(plugin = ...)` to add an instance of the plugin to the Analytics timeline.

```
    analytics = Analytics("<YOUR WRITE KEY>", applicationContext) {
        this.flushAt = 3
        this.trackApplicationLifecycleEvents = true
    }
    analytics.add(plugin = BugsnagDestination())
```

Your events will now begin to flow to bugsnag in device mode.
